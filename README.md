# Wine-Quality-Analysis

In this project, we are using the language Python for Data exploration and analysis. We have been given a dataset of Red Wine properties. The dataset is taken from kaggle. The link to the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009 .

The first part of studying the dataset is Exploratory Data Analysis. We do so by cleaning the dataset by using appropriate means. Then we draw various charts and perform Univariate and Bivariate analysis to recognise the patterns between different columns of the dataset.

The next part is splitting the dataset into traing and testing parts and applying different ML algorithms to predict certain values.

The final part is to check the accuracy of the models and to compare them.
